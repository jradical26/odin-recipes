        <h2>An invaluable asset to a Chef's culinary skills</h2>
        <p>Heaven and Earth came together to assemble this devine dish of mashed potatoes, mixed with carefully chosen seasonings and a light finish of butter to sweeten the deal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large potatoes, reasonably diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of butter</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes, then return to the pot. Turn heat to high and allow potatoes to dry for about 30 seconds. Turn off heat.</li>
            <li>Mash potatoes with a potato masher twice around the pot, then add milk and butter. Continue to mash until smooth and fluffy. Whisk in salt and black pepper until evenly distributed, about 15 seconds.</li>
